      Initialize nostromo which will create a manifest under ~/.nostromo by running:

        nostromo init

      You can get started adding commands by running the following interactive command:

        nostromo add

      If you have remote manifests already, you can quickly get them by running:

        nostromo dock <url>

      Be sure to source your shell profile after initializing nostromo for auto-complete to work.
