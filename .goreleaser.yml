      Initialize nostromo and create a manifest under ~/.nostromo by running:

        nostromo init
      
      You can add shell bindings for autocompletion adding these to your init file(s):
        eval "$(nostromo completion)" # for bash
        eval "$(nostromo completion --zsh)" # for zsh

    # Your app's homepage.
    # Default is empty.
    homepage: "https://nostromo.sh"

    # Your app's description.
    # Default is empty.
    description: "nostromo is a CLI to manage aliases through simple commands to add and remove scoped aliases and substitutions."

    # Setting this will prevent goreleaser to actually try to commit the updated
    # formula - instead, the formula file will be stored on the dist folder only,
    # leaving the responsibility of publishing it to the user.
    # If set to auto, the release will not be uploaded to the homebrew tap
    # in case there is an indicator for prerelease in the tag e.g. v1.0.0-rc1
    # Default is false.
    skip_upload: false

    # So you can `brew test` your formula.
    # Default is empty.
    test: |
      system "#{bin}/nostromo help"

    # Custom install script for brew.
    # Default is 'bin.install "program"'.
    install: |
      bin.install "nostromo"
