`nostromo` is a CLI to manage aliases through simple commands to add and remove scoped aliases and substitutions.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/intro.gif" alt="intro" style="border-radius: 15px">
</p>

Managing aliases can be tedious and difficult to set up. `nostromo` makes this process easy and reliable. The tool adds shortcuts to your `.bashrc` / `.zshrc` that call into the `nostromo` binary. It reads and manages all aliases within its manifest. This is used to find and execute the actual command as well as swap any substitutions to simplify calls.

`nostromo` can help you build complex tools in a declarative way. Tools commonly allow you to run multi-level commands like `git rebase master branch` or `docker rmi b750fe78269d` which are clear to use. Imagine if you could wrap your aliases / commands / workflow into custom commands that describe things you do often. Well, now you can with nostromo. 🤓

With `nostromo` you can take aliases like these:

```sh
alias ios-build='pushd $IOS_REPO_PATH;xcodebuild -workspace Foo.xcworkspace -scheme foo_scheme'
alias ios-test='pushd $IOS_REPO_PATH;xcodebuild -workspace Foo.xcworkspace -scheme foo_test_scheme'
alias android-build='pushd $ANDROID_REPO_PATH;./gradlew build'
alias android-test='pushd $ANDROID_REPO_PATH;./gradlew test'
```

and turn them into declarative commands like this:

```sh
build ios
build android
test ios
test android
```

The possibilities are endless 🚀 and up to your imagination with the ability to compose commands as you see fit.

### Prerequisites

- Works for MacOS and `bash` / `zsh` shells (other combinations untested _but may work_)

### Installation

Using `brew`:

```sh
brew tap pokanop/pokanop
brew install nostromo
```

Using `go get`:

```sh
go get -u github.com/pokanop/nostromo
```

### Initialization

This command will initialize `nostromo` and create a manifest under `~/.nostromo`:

```sh
nostromo init
```

To customize the directory (and change it from `~/.nostromo`), set the `NOSTROMO_HOME` environment variable to a location of your choosing.

> With every update, it's a good idea to run `nostromo init` to ensure any manifest changes are migrated and commands continue to work. `nostromo` will attempt to perform any migrations as well at this time to files and folders so 🤞

The quickest way to populate your commands database is using the `dock` feature:

```sh
nostromo dock <source>
```

where `source` can be any local or remote file sources. See the [Distributed Manifests](#distributed-manifests) section for more details.

To destroy the core manifest and start over you can always run:

```sh
nostromo destroy
```

Backups of manifests are automatically taken to prevent data loss in case of shenanigans gone wrong. These are located under `${NOSTROMO_HOME}/backups`. The maximum number of backups can be configured with the `backupCount` manifest setting.

```sh
nostromo set backupCount 10
```

### Managing Aliases

Aliases to commands is one of the core features provided by `nostromo`. Instead of constantly updating shell profiles manually, `nostromo` will automatically keep it updated with the latest additions.

> Given that `nostromo` is not a shell command there are some things to note on how it makes its magic:
>
> - _Commands are generated by `nostromo` and executed using the `eval` method in a shell function._
> - _Commands and changes will be available immediately since `nostromo` reloads completions automatically_
>
> If you want create boring standard **shell aliases** you can do that with an additional flag or a config setting described below.

To add an alias (or command in `nostromo` parlance), simply run:

```sh
nostromo add cmd foo "echo bar"
```

And just like that you can now run `foo` like any other alias.

Descriptions for your commands can easily be added as well:

```sh
nostromo add cmd foo "echo bar" -d "My magical foo command that prints bar"
```

> Your descriptions will show up in the shell when autocompleting!

#### Interactive Mode

You can also add commands and substitutions **interactively** by using just `nostromo add` without any arguments. This command will walk through prompts to guide adding new commands easily.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/interactive.gif" alt="interactive" style="border-radius: 15px">
</p>

#### Keypaths

`nostromo` uses the concept of keypaths to simplify building commands and accessing the command tree. A keypath is simply a `.` delimited string that represents the path to the command.

For example:

```sh
nostromo add cmd foo.bar.baz 'echo hello'
```

will build the command tree for `foo` 👉 `bar` 👉 `baz` such that any of these commands are now valid (of course the first two do nothing _yet_ 😉):

```sh
foo
foo bar
foo bar baz
```

where the last one will execute the `echo` command.

You can compose several commands together by adding commands at any node of the keypath. The **default** behavior is to concatenate the commands together as you walk the tree. Targeted use of `;` or `&&` can allow for running multiple commands together instead of concatenating. More easily, you can change the command `mode` for any of the commands to do this for you automatically. More info on this later.

#### Shell Aliases

`nostromo` allows users to manage shell aliases. By default, all commands are designed to execute the binary and resolve a command to be evaluated in the shell. This allows you to run those declarative commands easily like `foo bar baz` in the shell. It only creates an alias as a shell function for the root command `foo` and passes the remaining arguments to `nostromo eval` to evaluate the command tree. The result of that is executed with `eval` in the shell. Standard shell aliases **do not** get this behavior.

> The use of standard shell aliases provides limited benefit if you only want single tiered aliases. Additionally, commands persist in the shell since they are evaluated (i.e., changing directories via `cd`).

There are two methods for adding aliases to your shell profile that are considered standard aliases:

- Use the `--alias-only` or `-a` flag when using `nostromo add cmd`
- Set the `aliasesOnly` config setting to affect all command additions

For example, you can see both methods here:

```sh
nostromo add cmd foo.bar.baz "cd /tmp" --alias-only

nostromo set aliasesOnly true
nostromo add cmd foo.bar.baz "cd /tmp"
```

Adding a standard alias will produce this line that gets sourced:

```sh
alias foo.bar.baz='cd /tmp'
```

instead of a `nostromo` command which adds a shell function:

```sh
foo() { eval $(nostromo eval foo "$*") }
```

> Notice how the keypath has no affect in building a command tree when using the **alias only** feature. Standard shell aliases can only be root level commands.

### Scoped Commands And Substitutions

Scope affects a tree of commands such that a parent scope is prepended first and then each command in the keypath to the root. If a command is run as follows:

```sh
foo bar baz
```

then the command associated with `foo` is concatenated first, then `bar`, and finally `baz`. So if these commands were configured like this:

```sh
nostromo add cmd foo 'echo oof'
nostromo add cmd foo.bar 'rab'
nostromo add cmd foo.bar.baz 'zab'
```

then the actual execution would result in:

```sh
echo oof rab zab
```

> Standard behavior is to `concatenate` but you can easily change this with the `mode` flag when using `add` or globally. More information under Execution Modes.

#### Substitutions

`nostromo` also provides the ability to add substitutions at each one of these scopes in the command tree. So if you want to shorten common strings that are otherwise long into substitutions, you can attach them to a parent scope and `nostromo` will replace them at execution time for all instances.

A substitution can be added with:

```sh
nostromo add sub foo.bar //some/long/string sls
```

Subsequent calls to `foo bar` would replace the subs before running. This command:

```sh
foo bar baz sls
```

would finally result in the following since the substitution is in scope:

```sh
oof rab zab //some/long/string
```

### Complex Command Tree

Given features like **keypaths** and **scope** you can build a complex set of commands and effectively your own tool 🤯 that performs additive functionality with each command node.

You can get a quick snapshot of the command tree using:

```sh
nostromo show
```

With nostromo, you can also visualize the command tree (or manifest) in several other ways including as `json`, `yaml` and a tree itself.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/tree.gif" alt="tree" style="border-radius: 15px">
</p>

Setting the `verbose` config setting prints more detailed information as well for all commands.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/verbose.gif" alt="verbose" style="border-radius: 15px">
</p>

#### Execution Modes

A command's mode indicates how it will be executed. By default, `nostromo` concatenates parent and child commands along the tree. There are 3 modes available to commands:

```sh
  concatenate  Concatenate this command with subcommands exactly as defined
  independent  Execute this command with subcommands using ';' to separate
  exclusive    Execute this and only this command ignoring parent commands
```

The mode can be set when adding a command with the `-m` or `--mode` flag:

```sh
nostromo add cmd foo.bar.baz -m exclusive "echo baz"
```

A global setting can also be set to change the mode from the default `concatenate` with:

```sh
nostromo set mode independent
```

> All subsequent commands would inherit the above mode if set.

### Shell Completion

`nostromo` provides completion scripts to allow tab completion. This is added by default to your shell init file:

```sh
eval "$(nostromo completion)"
```

Even your commands added by `nostromo` get the full red carpet treatment with shell completion. Be sure to add a description and tab completion will show hints at each junction of your command. Cool right! 😎

### Execute Code Snippets

`nostromo` provides the ability to supply code snippets in the following languages for execution, in lieu of the standard shell command:

- `ruby` - runs ruby interpreter
- `python` - runs python interpreter
- `js` - runs node
- `perl` - runs perl interpreter

```sh
nostromo add cmd foo --code 'console.log("hello js")' --language js
```

For more complex snippets you can edit `~/.nostromo/ships/manifest.yaml` directly but multiline YAML must be escaped correctly to work.

### Distributed Manifests

`nostromo` now supports keeping multiple manifest sources 💪 allowing you to organize and distribute your commands as you please. This feature enables synchronization functionality to get remote manifests from multiple data sources including:

- Local Files
- Git
- Mercurial
- HTTP
- Amazon S3
- Google GCS

> Details on supported file formats and requirements can be found in the [go-getter](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-getter) documentation as `nostromo` uses that for downloading files

Configs can be found in the `~/.nostromo/ships` folder. The **core manifest** is named `manifest.yaml`.

You can add as many additional manifests in the same folder and `nostromo` will parse and aggregate all the commands, useful for organizations wanting to build their own command suite.

To add or dock manifests, use the following:

```sh
nostromo dock <source>...
```

And that's it! Your commands will now incorporate the new manifest.

To update docked manifests to the latest versions (omit sources to update all manifests), just run:

```sh
nostromo sync <name>...
```

`nostromo` syncs manifests using version information in the manifest. It will only update if the version identifier is different. To force update a manifest, run:

```sh
nostromo sync -f <name>...
```

If you're tired of someone else's manifest or it just isn't making you happy ☹️ then just undock it with:

```sh
nostromo undock <name>
```

So you've created an awesome suite of commands and you like to share, am I right? Well `nostromo` makes it super easy to create manifests with any set of your commands from the tree using the `detach` command. It lets you slice and dice your manifests by extracting out a command node into a new manifest.

```sh
nostromo detach <name> <key.path>...
```

By default, this removes the command nodes from the original (core) manifest but can be kept intact as well with the `-k` option.

Since `nostromo` updates manifests if the identifier is unique, there might be times you want to update the `yaml` files manually for whatever reason. In this case you can run the handy `uuidgen` command to update the identifier so you can push the manifest to others:

```sh
nostromo uuidgen <name>
```

### Themes

`nostromo` now supports themes to make it look even more neat. There's 3 themes currently which can be set with:

```sh
nostromo set theme <name>
```

where valid themes include:

- `default`: The basic theme and previous default
- `grayscale`: Gray colored things are sometimes nice
- `emoji`: The new default obviously

Enjoy!
